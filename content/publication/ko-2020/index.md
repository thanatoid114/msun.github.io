abstract: We report on a peculiar propagation of bosons loaded by a short Laguerre--Gaussian
  pulse in a nearly flat band of a lattice potential. Taking a system of exciton polaritons
  in a kagome lattice as an example, we show that an initially localized condensate
  propagates in a specific direction in space, if anisotropy is taken into account.
  This propagation consists of quantum jumps, collapses, and revivals of the whole
  compact states, and it persists given any direction of anisotropy. This property
  reveals its signatures in the tight-binding model, and, surprisingly, it is much
  more pronounced in a continuous model. Quantum revivals are robust to the repulsive
  interaction and finite lifetime of the particles. Since no magnetic field or spin--orbit
  interaction is required, this system provides a new kind of easily implementable
  optical logic.
