abstract: We give a general illumination of a rotating black string falling into a
  rotating horizon in dimension D=5. It is a configuration of one smooth intersection
  between these two objects when the spacetime is axisymmetric and in the limit that
  the thickness of the black hole is much larger than the thickness of the black string.
  Following this configuration, we further extend them to the rotating and charged
  flows.
