 abstract = {We propose a mechanism for robust Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer-like superconductivity in graphene placed in the vicinity of a Bose--Einstein condensate. Electrons in the graphene interact with the excitations above the condensate, called Bogoliubov quasiparticles (or bogolons). It turns out that bogolon-pair-mediated interaction allows us to surpass the long-standing problem of the vanishing density of states of particles with a linear spectrum. This results in a dramatic enhancement of the superconducting properties of graphene while keeping its relativistic dispersion. We study the behavior of the superconducting gap and calculate critical temperatures in cases with single-bogolon and bogolon-pair-mediated pairing processes, accounting for the complex band structure of graphene. We also compare the critical temperature of the superconducting transition with the BKT temperature.},
