abstract: We propose a mechanism for robust Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer-like superconductivity
  in graphene placed in the vicinity of a Bose--Einstein condensate. Electrons in
  the graphene interact with the excitations above the condensate, called Bogoliubov
  quasiparticles (or bogolons). It turns out that bogolon-pair-mediated interaction
  allows us to surpass the long-standing problem of the vanishing density of states
  of particles with a linear spectrum. This results in a dramatic enhancement of the
  superconducting properties of graphene while keeping its relativistic dispersion.
  We study the behavior of the superconducting gap and calculate critical temperatures
  in cases with single-bogolon and bogolon-pair-mediated pairing processes, accounting
  for the complex band structure of graphene. We also compare the critical temperature
  of the superconducting transition with the BKT temperature.
