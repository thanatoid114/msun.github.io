abstract: We report on a novel mechanism of BCS-like superconductivity, mediated by
  a pair of Bogoliubov quasiparticles (bogolons). It takes place in hybrid systems
  consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas in a transition metal dichalcogenide
  monolayer in the vicinity of a Bose--Einstein condensate. Taking a system of two-dimensional
  indirect excitons as a testing ground of Bose-Einstein condensate we show, that
  the bogolon-pair-mediated electron pairing mechanism is stronger than phonon-mediated
  and single bogolon-mediated ones. We develop a microscopic theory of bogolon-pair-mediated
  superconductivity, based on the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation and the Gorrqkovrqs
  equations, study the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap and estimate
  the critical temperature of superconducting transition for various electron concentrations
  in the electron gas and the condensate densities.
