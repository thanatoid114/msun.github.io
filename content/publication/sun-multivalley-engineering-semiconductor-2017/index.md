abstract: We consider exciton-photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities in which
  separate periodic potentials have been embedded for excitons and photons. We show
  theoretically that this system supports degenerate ground-states appearing at non-zero
  inplane momenta, corresponding to multiple valleys in reciprocal space, which are
  further separated in polarization corresponding to a polarization-valley coupling
  in the system. Aside forming a basis for valleytronics, the multivalley dispersion
  is predicted to allow for spontaneous momentum symmetry breaking and two-mode squeezing
  under non-resonant and resonant excitation, respectively.
