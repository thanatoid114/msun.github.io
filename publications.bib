  abstract = {We report on a peculiar propagation of bosons loaded by a short Laguerre--Gaussian pulse in a nearly flat band of a lattice potential. Taking a system of exciton polaritons in a kagome lattice as an example, we show that an initially localized condensate propagates in a specific direction in space, if anisotropy is taken into account. This propagation consists of quantum jumps, collapses, and revivals of the whole compact states, and it persists given any direction of anisotropy. This property reveals its signatures in the tight-binding model, and, surprisingly, it is much more pronounced in a continuous model. Quantum revivals are robust to the repulsive interaction and finite lifetime of the particles. Since no magnetic field or spin--orbit interaction is required, this system provides a new kind of easily implementable optical logic.},

  abstract = {In the case of structureless bosons, cooled down to low temperatures, the absorption of electromagnetic waves by their Bose-Einstein condensate is usually forbidden due to the momentum and energy conservation laws: the phase velocity of the collective modes of the condensate called bogolons is sufficiently lower than the speed of light. Thus, only the light scattering processes persist. However, the situation might be different in the case of composite bosons or the bosons with an internal structure. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a Bose--Einstein condensates of cold atoms in various dimensions, utilizing the Bogoliubov model of a weakly-interacting Bose gas. Thus, we address the transitions between a collective coherent state of bosons and the discrete energy levels corresponding to excited internal degrees of freedom of non-condensed individual bosons. It is shown, that such transitions are mediated by one and two-bogolon excitations above the condensate, which demonstrate different efficiency at different frequencies and strongly depend on the condensate density, which influence varies depending on the dimensionality of the system.},

Taking a system of two-dimensional indirect excitons as a testing ground of Bose-Einstein condensate we show, that the bogolon-pair-mediated electron pairing mechanism is stronger than phonon-mediated and single bogolon-mediated ones. We develop a microscopic theory of bogolon-pair-mediated superconductivity, based on the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation and the Gor{\textbackslash}rqkov{\textbackslash}rqs equations, study the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap and estimate the critical temperature of superconducting transition for various electron concentrations in the electron gas and the condensate densities.},

It turns out that bogolon-pair-mediated interaction allows us to surpass the long-standing problem of the vanishing density of states of particles with a linear spectrum. This results in a dramatic enhancement of the superconducting properties of graphene while keeping its relativistic dispersion. We study the behavior of the superconducting gap and calculate critical temperatures in cases with single-bogolon and bogolon-pair-mediated pairing processes, accounting for the complex band structure of graphene. We also compare the critical temperature of the superconducting transition with the BKT temperature.},
